# employee-tracker-pedro-guerra

## Description

In this bootcamp challenge, the main goal is to build a code that will allow management of a company's employee database. With the help of node.js, inquirer, and MySQL,
a user will be able to navigate through and modify the company's employee database. There was no starter code provided, so all javascript and SQL was made from scratch.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This challenged allowed me to improve my JavaScript & SQL skills, as I had to create a code from scratch. The main conflict I ran into that took me the longest to figure out was that I had to create a database since when I ran the code it stated that my database did not exist.
